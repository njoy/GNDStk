We're putting these into version control in order to track our changes, which
we hope will be relatively small. (Except for some prettyprinting we'll do,
through an editor, as the first change.) Substantive changes are geared towards
the goal of helping our automatic code-generation tool to work more smoothly.

The following changes have been made:
  - The 'gpdc' namespace is renamed to 'containers', as a result summary_gpdc.json
    has been renamed to summary_containers.json.
  - The type of the 'style' attribute on a grid element is renamed to gridStyle since
    it is an enumerator
  - The 'href' attribute in the link element is required
  - The 'occurrence' attribute of the axes element children (axis and grid) has been
    set to choice+

The following should be brought to the attention of EG-GNDS:
  - Proper description of the enumerated values for the grid style (the GNDS 1.9
    specs do not mention link while it is used in GNDS files)
